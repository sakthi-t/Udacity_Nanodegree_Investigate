# Udacity_Nanodegree_Investigate
This is the first project using python, numpy, &amp; pandas

I chose a gapminder dataset 'Long Term Unemployment Rate Percentage'
I summarize long term unemployment increases over years

The important thing is that I incorporated as many as concepts of the entire Nanodegree in this first project itself
I made use of pd melt and ensured that columns are variables and not values

I have summarized findings using various visualizations
